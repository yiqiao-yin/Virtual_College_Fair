# Project 2: Shiny App Development Version 2.0

### Data folder

The data directory contains data used in the analysis. This is treated as read only; in paricular the R/python files are never allowed to write to the files in here. Depending on the project, these might be csv files, a database, and the directory itself may have subdirectories.

### Remark

- We left some old files from previous group in this folder so that in the future we can come back and check them when necessary.
- We also uploaded our new files, final3data.csv, final4data_crimedata.csv, final5data_ACT Enrollment Crime Deadline_Oct5th.csv, and history.RData.
- The files (specifically data) in this folder are read only. We have files in the app folder for convenience so that we can check the code within the same working directory in the ui and server files.
