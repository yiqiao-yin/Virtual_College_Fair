# Project 2: Shiny App Development Version 2.0

### Doc folder

The doc directory contains the report or presentation files. It can have subfolders.  

### Remark

In the subfolder, figs, we uploaded screen shots. These pictures are for illustration purpose only for the ReadMe file in the first page of Github repo. 

They are also presented here. The front page of our app looks like the following.

The main data presentation page of our app looks like the following.

We also have a designated slider matplot page that looks like the following.

We believe the above updates are significant improvements from the previous Shiny App and we are confident that our targeted audience (e.g. students/parents who are interested in applying to U.S. universities/colleges) can get a good feeling of the situation here.
