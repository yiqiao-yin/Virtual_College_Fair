Summary: In this project, we developed a virtual college fair that allows audience such as CollegeBoard or high-school students to navigate efficiently and filter through over 200 colleges/universities in United States according to the preferred preferences. The app has a filter section and a sorting section. The two sections allow users to select and choose a number of parameters and the main panel on the platform will generate map and table data accordingly.
