# Project 2: Shiny App Development Version 2.0
### App folder

The App directory contains the app files for the Shiny App (i.e., ui.r and server.r). 

- The app consists of ui and server. Both are uploaded in the folder.
- The ui file defines the user interface (front-end) of the platform. The server file defines the algorithms and functions behind the platform (back-dend). Both files need to work together for the app to load and we are certain that the progress works smoothly as it can be published on R Shiny website.
- To ensure our platform is user-friendly, we have a few CSS code embedded in ui file to edit the output of the site for the purpose of font size and so on.  
- The app folder also has data set uploaded as well.
- The app uses final3data as the final data set input for ui and server. 
- We, Group 8, together have approved the design of this app.
